===============

The final code of an exercise for learning how to put together a basic board game in HTML5 (made for a workshop at NTU Singapore sponsored by Mozilla). The game is "4 in a row".

This exercise is intended to be completed in 2 hours by students with some basic knowledge of web development. To run the game, clone the repo and open index.html. The diagonal win condition was left as an exercise for more advanced students.
